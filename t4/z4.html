<p>So, where are ya? It's been a little while
<br>Sippin' on straight chlorine
<br>Let the vibe slide over me
<br>This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
<br>When I leave, don't save my seat
<br>I'll be back when it's all complete
<br>The moment is medical, moment is medical
<br>Sippin' on straight chlorine
<br>Lovin' what I'm tastin', woah
<br>Venom on my tongue, dependent at times
<br>Poisonous vibrations, woah
<br>Help my body run
<br>I'm runnin' for my life
<br>Runnin' for my life
<br>Sippin' on straight chlorine
<br>Let the vibe slide over me
<br>This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
<br >When I leave, don't save my seat
<br>I'll be back when it's all complete
<br>The moment is medical, moment is medical
<br>Sippin' on straight chlorine
<br>Fall out of formation, woah
<br>I plan my escape from walls they confined
<br>Rebel red carnation, woa-a-oh
<br>Grows while I decay
<br>I'm runnin' for my life
<br>Runnin' for my life
<br>Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life
<br>Runnin' for my life
<br>Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
<br>I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
<br>Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
<br>The last two lines may read incorrect until said
<br>The lead is terrible in flavor
<br>But now you double as a paper maker
<br>I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight
<br>And you in my life is like
<br>Sippin' on straight chlorine
<br>Let the vibe slide over me
<br>This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
<br>When I leave, don't save my seat
<br>I'll be back when it's all complete
<br>The moment is medical, moment is medical
<br>Sippin' on straight chlorine</p>
